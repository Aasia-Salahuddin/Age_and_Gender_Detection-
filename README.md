Developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to simultaneously predict age and gender from facial images using the UTKFace dataset.

Performed extensive data preprocessing including image loading, resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.

Designed a multi-output CNN architecture with separate output layers for gender classification and age regression.

Implemented model training with Keras, optimized using Adam, and evaluated performance with accuracy and mean absolute error (MAE).

Visualized training progress and model predictions with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Achieved robust performance in gender classification and age estimation tasks using deep learning techniques.

Tools & Technologies: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV/Pillow, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
